- 👋 Hi, I’m @kwakuman
- 👀 I’m interested in Python. I am currently using it for automating boring stuff, going beyond the basics.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning OOP in Python and planning to move on to PostgreSQL.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with people that could use a beginner like me to write small snippets as part of something bigger.
- 📫 You can reach me on kwakuman@pm.me
